# PDF-to-TXT Extractor

This tool extracts plain text from very large PDFs (e.g. a 5000-page Bible or medical records), with support for both native text extraction and OCR for scanned image pages. It's optimized for fresh Windows systems and assumes no prior installations.

## Why This Tool?

PDFs, especially scanned books and medical files, are difficult to convert into clean text. This tool solves that by:
- Extracting text from PDFs directly (when possible)
- Automatically running OCR (Tesseract) for image-based pages
- Outputting a clean `.txt` file ready for reading or training an LLM
